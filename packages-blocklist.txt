> vitest (2.1.6): 
  - on updating to version >= 2.1.7, an Unknown Error: [object Object] is thrown.
  - ref: https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/12384#issuecomment-2518269691
> @eslint/compat (1.1.1):
  - fails with the error ERESOLVE could not resolve due to a conflict between eslint versions.
  - The conflict arises because @eslint/compat@1.2.4 requires eslint@^9.10.0 as peerOptional.
> husky (8.0.3):
  - when incrementing the version in package.json (>= 8.0.4), an error occurs: MODULE_NOT_FOUND because the module husky/lib/bin.js is not found.
> eslint (8.57.1):
  - updating eslint to version >= 8.57.2 will cause a dependency conflict as other dependencies may require eslint@8.57.1.
> @vitest/coverage-v8 (2.1.6):
  - Has a version compatibility issue with vitest, as both need to be at the same version.
